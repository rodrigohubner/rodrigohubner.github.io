# About me

I'm a professor at Federal University of Tecnology - Paraná in department of Computer Science.

In my work with neuroscience, I'm researching how to apply ``decision-making'' in BCI. For it, I'm using paradigms as Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) and P300. I'm also building simulated methods on computer to make a feedback stimulis and physical simulations using leds and automated robots.

Below are some timelines about me:
